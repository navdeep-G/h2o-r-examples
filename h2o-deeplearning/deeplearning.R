### Introduction
#This tutorial shows how a H2O [Deep Learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) model can be used to do supervised classification and regression. A great tutorial about Deep Learning is given by Quoc Le [here](http://cs.stanford.edu/~quocle/tutorial1.pdf) and [here](http://cs.stanford.edu/~quocle/tutorial2.pdf). This tutorial covers usage of H2O from R. A python version of this tutorial will be available as well in a separate document. This file is available in plain R, R markdown and regular markdown formats, and the plots are available as PDF files. All documents are available [on Github](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-tutorials/tree/master/tutorials/deeplearning/).
#
#If run from plain R, execute R in the directory of this script. If run from RStudio, be sure to setwd() to the location of this script. h2o.init() starts H2O in R's current working directory. h2o.importFile() looks for files from the perspective of where H2O was started.
#
#More examples and explanations can be found in our [H2O Deep Learning booklet](http://h2o.ai/resources/) and on our [H2O Github Repository](http://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/). The PDF slide deck can be found [on Github](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-tutorials/tree/master/tutorials/deeplearning/H2ODeepLearning.pdf).
#
#### H2O R Package
#
#Load the H2O R package:
#
## R installation instructions are at http://h2o.ai/download
library(h2o)
#
#### Start H2O
#Start up a 1-node H2O server on your local machine, and allow it to use all CPU cores and up to 2GB of memory:
#
h2o.init(nthreads=-1, max_mem_size="2G")
h2o.removeAll() ## clean slate - just in case the cluster was already running
#
#The `h2o.deeplearning` function fits H2O's Deep Learning models from within R.
#We can run the example from the man page using the `example` function, or run a longer demonstration from the `h2o` package using the `demo` function:
#
args(h2o.deeplearning)
help(h2o.deeplearning)
example(h2o.deeplearning)
#demo(h2o.deeplearning)  #requires user interaction
#
#While H2O Deep Learning has many parameters, it was designed to be just as easy to use as the other supervised training methods in H2O. Early stopping, automatic data standardization and handling of categorical variables and missing values and adaptive learning rates (per weight) reduce the amount of parameters the user has to specify. Often, it's just the number and sizes of hidden layers, the number of epochs and the activation function and maybe some regularization techniques.
#
#### Let's have some fun first: Decision Boundaries
#We start with a small dataset representing red and black dots on a plane, arranged in the shape of two nested spirals. Then we task H2O's machine learning methods to separate the red and black dots, i.e., recognize each spiral as such by assigning each point in the plane to one of the two spirals.
#
#We visualize the nature of H2O Deep Learning (DL), H2O's tree methods (GBM/DRF) and H2O's generalized linear modeling (GLM) by plotting the decision boundary between the red and black spirals:
#
setwd("~/h2o-tutorials/tutorials/deeplearning") ##For RStudio
spiral <- h2o.importFile(path = normalizePath("../data/spiral.csv"))
grid   <- h2o.importFile(path = normalizePath("../data/grid.csv"))
# Define helper to plot contours
plotC <- function(name, model, data=spiral, g=grid) {
  data <- as.data.frame(data) #get data from into R
  pred <- as.data.frame(h2o.predict(model, g))
  n=0.5*(sqrt(nrow(g))-1); d <- 1.5; h <- d*(-n:n)/n
  plot(data[,-3],pch=19,col=data[,3],cex=0.5,
       xlim=c(-d,d),ylim=c(-d,d),main=name)
  contour(h,h,z=array(ifelse(pred[,1]=="Red",0,1),
          dim=c(2*n+1,2*n+1)),col="blue",lwd=2,add=T)
}
#
#We build a few different models:
#
#dev.new(noRStudioGD=FALSE) #direct plotting output to a new window
par(mfrow=c(2,2)) #set up the canvas for 2x2 plots
plotC( "DL", h2o.deeplearning(1:2,3,spiral,epochs=1e3))
plotC("GBM", h2o.gbm         (1:2,3,spiral))
plotC("DRF", h2o.randomForest(1:2,3,spiral))
plotC("GLM", h2o.glm         (1:2,3,spiral,family="binomial"))
#
#Let's investigate some more Deep Learning models. First, we explore the evolution over training time (number of passes over the data), and we use checkpointing to continue training the same model:
#
#dev.new(noRStudioGD=FALSE) #direct plotting output to a new window
par(mfrow=c(2,2)) #set up the canvas for 2x2 plots
ep <- c(1,250,500,750)
plotC(paste0("DL ",ep[1]," epochs"),
      h2o.deeplearning(1:2,3,spiral,epochs=ep[1],
                              model_id="dl_1"))
plotC(paste0("DL ",ep[2]," epochs"),
      h2o.deeplearning(1:2,3,spiral,epochs=ep[2],
            checkpoint="dl_1",model_id="dl_2"))
plotC(paste0("DL ",ep[3]," epochs"),
      h2o.deeplearning(1:2,3,spiral,epochs=ep[3],
            checkpoint="dl_2",model_id="dl_3"))
plotC(paste0("DL ",ep[4]," epochs"),
      h2o.deeplearning(1:2,3,spiral,epochs=ep[4],
            checkpoint="dl_3",model_id="dl_4"))
#
#You can see how the network learns the structure of the spirals with enough training time. We explore different network architectures next:
#
#dev.new(noRStudioGD=FALSE) #direct plotting output to a new window
par(mfrow=c(2,2)) #set up the canvas for 2x2 plots
for (hidden in list(c(11,13,17,19),c(42,42,42),c(200,200),c(1000))) {
  plotC(paste0("DL hidden=",paste0(hidden, collapse="x")),
        h2o.deeplearning(1:2,3,spiral,hidden=hidden,epochs=500))
}
#
#It is clear that different configurations can achieve similar performance, and that tuning will be required for optimal performance. Next, we compare between different activation functions, including one with 50% dropout regularization in the hidden layers:
#
#dev.new(noRStudioGD=FALSE) #direct plotting output to a new window
par(mfrow=c(2,2)) #set up the canvas for 2x2 plots
for (act in c("Tanh","Maxout","Rectifier","RectifierWithDropout")) {
  plotC(paste0("DL ",act," activation"), 
        h2o.deeplearning(1:2,3,spiral,
              activation=act,hidden=c(100,100),epochs=1000))
}
#
#Clearly, the dropout rate was too high or the number of epochs was too low for the last configuration, which often ends up performing the best on larger datasets where generalization is important.
#
#More information about the parameters can be found in the [H2O Deep Learning booklet](http://h2o.ai/resources/).
#
### Cover Type Dataset
#We important the full cover type dataset (581k rows, 13 columns, 10 numerical, 3 categorical).
#We also split the data 3 ways: 60% for training, 20% for validation (hyper parameter tuning) and 20% for final testing.
#
df <- h2o.importFile(path = normalizePath("../data/covtype.full.csv"))
dim(df)
df
splits <- h2o.splitFrame(df, c(0.6,0.2), seed=1234)
train  <- h2o.assign(splits[[1]], "train.hex") # 60%
valid  <- h2o.assign(splits[[2]], "valid.hex") # 20%
test   <- h2o.assign(splits[[3]], "test.hex")  # 20%
#
#Here's a scalable way to do scatter plots via binning (works for categorical and numeric columns) to get more familiar with the dataset.
#
#dev.new(noRStudioGD=FALSE) #direct plotting output to a new window
par(mfrow=c(1,1)) # reset canvas
plot(h2o.tabulate(df, "Elevation",                       "Cover_Type"))
plot(h2o.tabulate(df, "Horizontal_Distance_To_Roadways", "Cover_Type"))
plot(h2o.tabulate(df, "Soil_Type",                       "Cover_Type"))
plot(h2o.tabulate(df, "Horizontal_Distance_To_Roadways", "Elevation" ))
#
#### First Run of H2O Deep Learning
#Let's run our first Deep Learning model on the covtype dataset. 
#We want to predict the `Cover_Type` column, a categorical feature with 7 levels, and the Deep Learning model will be tasked to perform (multi-class) classification. It uses the other 12 predictors of the dataset, of which 10 are numerical, and 2 are categorical with a total of 44 levels. We can expect the Deep Learning model to have 56 input neurons (after automatic one-hot encoding).
#
response <- "Cover_Type"
predictors <- setdiff(names(df), response)
predictors
#
#To keep it fast, we only run for one epoch (one pass over the training data).
#
m1 <- h2o.deeplearning(
  model_id="dl_model_first", 
  training_frame=train, 
  validation_frame=valid,   ## validation dataset: used for scoring and early stopping
  x=predictors,
  y=response,
  #activation="Rectifier",  ## default
  #hidden=c(200,200),       ## default: 2 hidden layers with 200 neurons each

)
summary(m1)
#
#Inspect the model in [Flow](http://localhost:54321/) for more information about model building etc. by issuing a cell with the content `getModel "dl_model_first"`, and pressing Ctrl-Enter.
#
#### Variable Importances
#Variable importances for Neural Network models are notoriously difficult to compute, and there are many [pitfalls](ftp://ftp.sas.com/pub/neural/importance.html). H2O Deep Learning has implemented the method of [Gedeon](http://cs.anu.edu.au/~./Tom.Gedeon/pdfs/ContribDataMinv2.pdf), and returns relative variable importances in descending order of importance.
#
head(as.data.frame(h2o.varimp(m1)))
#
#### Early Stopping
#Now we run another, smaller network, and we let it stop automatically once the misclassification rate converges (specifically, if the moving average of length 2 does not improve by at least 1% for 2 consecutive scoring events). We also sample the validation set to 10,000 rows for faster scoring.
#
m2 <- h2o.deeplearning(
  model_id="dl_model_faster",

  epochs=1000000,                      ## hopefully converges earlier...
  score_validation_samples=10000,      ## sample the validation dataset (faster)
  stopping_rounds=2,
  stopping_metric="misclassification", ## could be "MSE","logloss","r2"
  stopping_tolerance=0.01
)
summary(m2)
plot(m2)
#
#### Adaptive Learning Rate
#By default, H2O Deep Learning uses an adaptive learning rate ([ADADELTA](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.5701v1.pdf)) for its stochastic gradient descent optimization. There are only two tuning parameters for this method: `rho` and `epsilon`, which balance the global and local search efficiencies. `rho` is the similarity to prior weight updates (similar to momentum), and `epsilon` is a parameter that prevents the optimization to get stuck in local optima. Defaults are `rho=0.99` and `epsilon=1e-8`. For cases where convergence speed is very important, it might make sense to perform a few runs to optimize these two parameters (e.g., with `rho in c(0.9,0.95,0.99,0.999)` and `epsilon in c(1e-10,1e-8,1e-6,1e-4)`). Of course, as always with grid searches, caution has to be applied when extrapolating grid search results to a different parameter regime (e.g., for more epochs or different layer topologies or activation functions, etc.).
#
#If `adaptive_rate` is disabled, several manual learning rate parameters become important: `rate`, `rate_annealing`, `rate_decay`, `momentum_start`, `momentum_ramp`, `momentum_stable` and `nesterov_accelerated_gradient`, the discussion of which we leave to [H2O Deep Learning booklet](http://h2o.ai/resources/).
#
#### Tuning
#With some tuning, it is possible to obtain less than 10% test set error rate in about one minute. Error rates of below 5% are possible with larger models. Note that deep tree methods can be more effective for this dataset than Deep Learning, as they directly partition the space into sectors, which seems to be needed here.

#    
#### Hyper-parameter Tuning with Grid Search
#Since there are a lot of parameters that can impact model accuracy, hyper-parameter tuning is especially important for Deep Learning:
#
#For speed, we will only train on the first 10,000 rows of the training dataset:
#
sampled_train=train[1:10000,]
#  
#The simplest hyperparameter search method is a brute-force scan of the full Cartesian product of all combinations specified by a grid search:
#

#

grid

## To see what other "sort_by" criteria are allowed
#grid <- h2o.getGrid("dl_grid",sort_by="wrong_thing",decreasing=FALSE)

## Sort by logloss
h2o.getGrid("dl_grid",sort_by="logloss",decreasing=FALSE)

## Find the best model and its full set of parameters
grid@summary_table[1,]
best_model <- h2o.getModel(grid@model_ids[[1]])
best_model

print(best_model@allparameters)
print(h2o.performance(best_model, valid=T))
print(h2o.logloss(best_model, valid=T))
#    
#### Random Hyper-Parameter Search
#Often, hyper-parameter search for more than 4 parameters can be done more efficiently with random parameter search than with grid search. Basically, chances are good to find one of many good models in less time than performing an exhaustive grid search. We simply build up to `max_models` models with parameters drawn randomly from user-specified distributions (here, uniform). For this example, we use the adaptive learning rate and focus on tuning the network architecture and the regularization parameters. We also let the grid search stop automatically once the performance at the top of the leaderboard doesn't change much anymore, i.e., once the search has converged.

####Checkpointing
#Let's continue training the manually tuned model from before, for 2 more epochs. Note that since many important parameters such as `epochs, l1, l2, max_w2, score_interval, train_samples_per_iteration, input_dropout_ratio, hidden_dropout_ratios, score_duty_cycle, classification_stop, regression_stop, variable_importances, force_load_balance` can be modified between checkpoint restarts, it is best to specify as many parameters as possible explicitly.

#
####Cross-Validation
#For N-fold cross-validation, specify `nfolds>1` instead of (or in addition to) a validation frame, and `N+1` models will be built: 1 model on the full training data, and N models with each 1/N-th of the data held out (there are different holdout strategies). Those N models then score on the held out data, and their combined predictions on the full training data are scored to get the cross-validation metrics.
#

  y=response, 
  training_frame=train,

  nfolds=5,
  fold_assignment="Modulo" # can be "AUTO", "Modulo", "Random" or "Stratified"
  )
dlmodel
#
#N-fold cross-validation is especially useful with early stopping, as the main model will pick the ideal number of epochs from the convergence behavior of the cross-validation models.
#
###Regression and Binary Classification
#Assume we want to turn the multi-class problem above into a binary classification problem. We create a binary response as follows:
#
train$bin_response <- ifelse(train[,response]=="class_1", 0, 1)
#
#Let's build a quick model and inspect the model:
#
dlmodel <- h2o.deeplearning(
  x=predictors,
  y="bin_response", 
  training_frame=train,
  hidden=c(10,10),
  epochs=0.1
)
summary(dlmodel)
#
#Instead of a binary classification model, we find a regression model (`H2ORegressionModel`) that contains only 1 output neuron (instead of 2). The reason is that the response was a numerical feature (ordinal numbers 0 and 1), and H2O Deep Learning was run with `distribution=AUTO`, which defaulted to a Gaussian regression problem for a real-valued response.
#H2O Deep Learning supports regression for distributions other than `Gaussian` such as `Poisson`, `Gamma`, `Tweedie`, `Laplace`. It also supports `Huber` loss and per-row offsets specified via an `offset_column`. We refer to our [H2O Deep Learning regression code examples](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/tree/master/h2o-r/tests/testdir_algos/deeplearning) for more information.
#
#To perform classification, the response must first be turned into a categorical (factor) feature:
#
train$bin_response <- as.factor(train$bin_response) ##make categorical
dlmodel <- h2o.deeplearning(
  x=predictors,
  y="bin_response", 
  training_frame=train,
  hidden=c(10,10),
  epochs=0.1
  #balance_classes=T    ## enable this for high class imbalance
)
summary(dlmodel) ## Now the model metrics contain AUC for binary classification
plot(h2o.performance(dlmodel)) ## display ROC curve
#

###H2O Deep Learning Tips & Tricks
#
#####Performance Tuning
#The [Definitive H2O Deep Learning Performance Tuning](http://blog.h2o.ai/2015/08/deep-learning-performance-august/) blog post covers many of the following points that affect the computational efficiency, so it's highly recommended.
#
#####Activation Functions
#While sigmoids have been used historically for neural networks, H2O Deep Learning implements `Tanh`, a scaled and shifted variant of the sigmoid which is symmetric around 0. Since its output values are bounded by -1..1, the stability of the neural network is rarely endangered. However, the derivative of the tanh function is always non-zero and back-propagation (training) of the weights is more computationally expensive than for rectified linear units, or `Rectifier`, which is `max(0,x)` and has vanishing gradient for `x<=0`, leading to much faster training speed for large networks and is often the fastest path to accuracy on larger problems. In case you encounter instabilities with the `Rectifier` (in which case model building is automatically aborted), try a limited value to re-scale the weights: `max_w2=10`. The `Maxout` activation function is computationally more expensive, but can lead to higher accuracy. It is a generalized version of the Rectifier with two non-zero channels. In practice, the `Rectifier` (and `RectifierWithDropout`, see below) is the most versatile and performant option for most problems.
#
#####Generalization Techniques
#L1 and L2 penalties can be applied by specifying the `l1` and `l2` parameters. Intuition: L1 lets only strong weights survive (constant pulling force towards zero), while L2 prevents any single weight from getting too big. [Dropout](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.0580.pdf) has recently been introduced as a powerful generalization technique, and is available as a parameter per layer, including the input layer. `input_dropout_ratio` controls the amount of input layer neurons that are randomly dropped (set to zero), while `hidden_dropout_ratios` are specified for each hidden layer. The former controls overfitting with respect to the input data (useful for high-dimensional noisy data), while the latter controls overfitting of the learned features. Note that `hidden_dropout_ratios` require the activation function to end with `...WithDropout`.
#
#####Early stopping and optimizing for lowest validation error
#By default, Deep Learning training stops when the `stopping_metric` does not improve by at least `stopping_tolerance` (0.01 means 1% improvement) for `stopping_rounds` consecutive scoring events on the training (or validation) data. By default, `overwrite_with_best_model` is enabled and the model returned after training for the specified number of epochs (or after stopping early due to convergence) is the model that has the best training set error (according to the metric specified by `stopping_metric`), or, if a validation set is provided, the lowest validation set error. Note that the training or validation set errors can be based on a subset of the training or validation data, depending on the values for `score_validation_samples` or `score_training_samples`, see below. For early stopping on a predefined error rate on the *training data* (accuracy for classification or MSE for regression), specify `classification_stop` or `regression_stop`.
#
#####Training Samples per MapReduce Iteration
#The parameter `train_samples_per_iteration` matters especially in multi-node operation. It controls the number of rows trained on for each MapReduce iteration. Depending on the value selected, one MapReduce pass can sample observations, and multiple such passes are needed to train for one epoch. All H2O compute nodes then communicate to agree on the best model coefficients (weights/biases) so far, and the model may then be scored (controlled by other parameters below). The default value of `-2` indicates auto-tuning, which attemps to keep the communication overhead at 5% of the total runtime. The parameter `target_ratio_comm_to_comp` controls this ratio. This parameter is explained in more detail in the [H2O Deep Learning booklet](http://h2o.ai/resources/),
#
#####Categorical Data
#For categorical data, a feature with K factor levels is automatically one-hot encoded (horizontalized) into K-1 input neurons. Hence, the input neuron layer can grow substantially for datasets with high factor counts. In these cases, it might make sense to reduce the number of hidden neurons in the first hidden layer, such that large numbers of factor levels can be handled. In the limit of 1 neuron in the first hidden layer, the resulting model is similar to logistic regression with stochastic gradient descent, except that for classification problems, there's still a softmax output layer, and that the activation function is not necessarily a sigmoid (`Tanh`). If variable importances are computed, it is recommended to turn on `use_all_factor_levels` (K input neurons for K levels). The experimental option `max_categorical_features` uses feature hashing to reduce the number of input neurons via the hash trick at the expense of hash collisions and reduced accuracy. Another way to reduce the dimensionality of the (categorical) features is to use `h2o.glrm()`, we refer to the GLRM tutorial for more details.
#
#####Sparse Data
#If the input data is sparse (many zeros), then it might make sense to enable the `sparse` option. This will result in the input not being standardized (0 mean, 1 variance), but only de-scaled (1 variance) and 0 values remain 0, leading to more efficient back-propagation. Sparsity is also a reason why CPU implementations can be faster than GPU implementations, because they can take advantage of if/else statements more effectively.
#
#####Missing Values
#H2O Deep Learning automatically does mean imputation for missing values during training (leaving the input layer activation at 0 after standardizing the values). For testing, missing test set values are also treated the same way by default. See the `h2o.impute` function to do your own mean imputation.
#
#####Loss functions, Distributions, Offsets, Observation Weights
#H2O Deep Learning supports advanced statistical features such as multiple loss functions, non-Gaussian distributions, per-row offsets and observation weights.
#In addition to `Gaussian` distributions and `Squared` loss, H2O Deep Learning supports `Poisson`, `Gamma`, `Tweedie` and `Laplace` distributions. It also supports `Absolute` and `Huber` loss and per-row offsets specified via an `offset_column`. Observation weights are supported via a user-specified `weights_column`.
#
#We refer to our [H2O Deep Learning R test code examples](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/tree/master/h2o-r/tests/testdir_algos/deeplearning) for more information.
#
#####Exporting Weights and Biases
#The model parameters (weights connecting two adjacent layers and per-neuron bias terms) can be stored as H2O Frames (like a dataset) by enabling `export_weights_and_biases`, and they can be accessed as follows:
#
iris_dl <- h2o.deeplearning(1:4,5,as.h2o(iris),
             export_weights_and_biases=T)
h2o.weights(iris_dl, matrix_id=1)
h2o.weights(iris_dl, matrix_id=2)
h2o.weights(iris_dl, matrix_id=3)
h2o.biases(iris_dl,  vector_id=1)
h2o.biases(iris_dl,  vector_id=2)
h2o.biases(iris_dl,  vector_id=3)
#plot weights connecting `Sepal.Length` to first hidden neurons
plot(as.data.frame(h2o.weights(iris_dl,  matrix_id=1))[,1])
#
#####Reproducibility
#Every run of DeepLearning results in different results since multithreading is done via [Hogwild!](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brecht/papers/hogwildTR.pdf) that benefits from intentional lock-free race conditions between threads. To get reproducible results for small datasets and testing purposes, set `reproducible=T` and set `seed=1337` (pick any integer). This will not work for big data for technical reasons, and is probably also not desired because of the significant slowdown (runs on 1 core only).
#    
#####Scoring on Training/Validation Sets During Training  
#The training and/or validation set errors *can* be based on a subset of the training or validation data, depending on the values for `score_validation_samples` (defaults to 0: all) or `score_training_samples` (defaults to 10,000 rows, since the training error is only used for early stopping and monitoring). For large datasets, Deep Learning can automatically sample the validation set to avoid spending too much time in scoring during training, especially since scoring results are not currently displayed in the model returned to R.
#                                
#Note that the default value of `score_duty_cycle=0.1` limits the amount of time spent in scoring to 10%, so a large number of scoring samples won't slow down overall training progress too much, but it will always score once after the first MapReduce iteration, and once at the end of training.
#
#Stratified sampling of the validation dataset can help with scoring on datasets with class imbalance.  Note that this option also requires `balance_classes` to be enabled (used to over/under-sample the training dataset, based on the max. relative size of the resulting training dataset, `max_after_balance_size`):
